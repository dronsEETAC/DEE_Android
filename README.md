# Android native apps
## 1. General description
The modules in this block are Apps developed for Android devices using Java or Kotlin. Native Android apps have better performance than WebApps although they require installations in the mobile device. 
Each of the modules in this block has a GitHub repo where you can find the code together with a description, installation instructions and demos. These are the repos:
